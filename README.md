# Tetris Game

This game is developed using [Flutter Flame](https://pub.dev/packages/flame).

There are special shapes called [helper shapes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18r5Nv9yu102OWOPv_WCQAg6dFP5RFFA0E-1rsWZcVvk). They may appear when it is nearly game over.

The document describing the important components of the game can be found in doc/Tetris.pdf in the project.
